# YouTube Data API
An experiment on how much data can be collected via the YouTube Data API.

API Reference: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs

## Why using an API?

Through an API we can access informations directly without downloading big datasets and search for the informations we especially need. The API is the interface which allows us to communicate with third-parties.
